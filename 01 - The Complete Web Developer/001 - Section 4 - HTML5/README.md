# HTML 5 notes
- Definition and Usage All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
    - The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
    - In HTML 5, the declaration is simple: ```<!DOCTYPE html>```
    - There are tons of html tags you can refer to [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) for references
    - We use ```<strong></strong>``` for bold
    - We use ```<i></i>``` for Italic or emphasis
    - There are ordered lists unordered lists
    - There are nested lists
    - ```<img src='path to image here'>``` this tag is for adding images
    - There are some self closing tags like ```<br>``` and ```<hr>```
    - Anchor tag is used to link resources
    - By default web Server Returns index.html page
    - Absolute vs Relative Path
        - With relative file paths, the files you intend to reference are located in the same folder of your website folder structure
        - On the other hand, with absolute file paths, you refer to external resources located elsewhere on the web
