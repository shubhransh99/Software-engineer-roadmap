# CSS
- selector {Property:value;} -- This is the base structure of css
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- The CSS prioritises the last selector most
- Three ways css can be written:
    1. Inline-stylesheet: meaning adding style atribute in the element itslf 
    2. OnPage Css meaning having ```<style></style>``` tag in the header of the page
    3. External css - most used where we create a seperate css file and then link it on the page
- There are tons of cool css properties
- Writing css follow top to botton in order of elements occuring in html
- Prefer to csstricks almanac to find properties
- Use unsplash for different high quality images
- Use Paletton to refer to different colour schemes 
- Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter.
    - .class
    - #id
    - ```*```
    - element
    - element, element
    - element element
    - element > element
    - element + element
    - :hover
    - :last-child
    - :first-child
    - !important (not recommended) 
- What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
    - Specificity
    - Importance
    - Source Order
